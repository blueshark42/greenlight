# Greenlight – Boost the future generation
Creative and talented students show us what's possible. Help them with the push to the peak and contribute not only to their education – but to society as a whole.

Our mission is to boost and help creative and talented students be at their peak and lead the future generation. A lot of students unfortunately lack funds necessary for their work or studies. Our goal is to provide a place where students can create campaigns and get financial aid from those that wish to help.

**Tools used:** React, MongoDB, Bootstrap
