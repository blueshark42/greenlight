        Our mission is to boost and help creative and talented students be at
        their peak and lead the future generation. A lot of students
        unfortunately lack funds necessary for their work or studies. Our goal
        is to provide a place where students can create campaigns and get
        financial aid from those that wish to help. No paperwork, no legal
        issues, none of the complexity other sites have, just people helping
        each other out.

              Greenlight is a reliable and safe platform for our campaigns.
