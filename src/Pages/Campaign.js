                    Hi everyone! We are working hard on finishing up right
                    before BP Week. We have made a ton of progress in the last
                    few weeks. We decided to sum up what we did in the last
                    week:
                  </p>
                  <p>We have finished working on the backend</p>
                  <p>The Discord server has been finished</p>
                  <p>
                    We introduced new standards on how we work as a team to
                    increase our efficiency
                  </p>
                  <p>Finished recruiting mentors and judges</p>
